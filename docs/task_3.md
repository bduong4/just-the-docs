# File Transferring to a Remote Computer

---

While having full control over a remote computer is the main feature of TeamViewer, you also have to ability to transfer files. Transferring files works for both sending files to the remote computer and receiving files from the remote computer.

Other than having to rely on uploading files to a storage site or program, you can use TeamViewer to transfer files back and forth when needed. 

If you would prefer to immediately store your file on the remote computer, then TeamViwer's file transferring option will allow you to access all paths of the remote computer.

One thing to note is that if you give another TeamViewer user full access to the file transfer of your remote computer, then this person may add or take any files they would like.
