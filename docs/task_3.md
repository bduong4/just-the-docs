# File Transferring to a Remote Desktop
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->

While having full control over a remote desktop is the main feature of TeamViewer, you also have to ability to transfer files. Transferring files works for both sending files to the remote desktop and receiving files from the remote desktop.

Other than having to rely on uploading files to a storage site or program, you can use TeamViewer to transfer files back and forth when needed. 

If you would prefer to immediately store your file on the remote desktop, then TeamViwer's file transferring option will allow you to access all paths of the remote desktop.

One thing to note is that if you give another TeamViewer user full access to the file transfer of your remote desktop, then this person may add or take any files they would like.
