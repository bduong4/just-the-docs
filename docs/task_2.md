# Setting up View-only Connections

---

You may notice when connecting to a remote computer that there are other options available other then "Full Access". These are different levels of Access controls that a user may request when connecting to a remote computer.

TeamViewer allows users to request an Access control called "View and show". When this option is selected it only gives you access to a view of the remote computer. You will lose privileges from "Full Access" and will be unable to do actions like control the remote computer mouse and input key strokes from your computer.

If you are at the remote computer and only want the other TeamViewer user to view your computer, you can enable an option that disables all other Access control request other then "View and show". 

This means you will not be able to accidentally give "Full Access" to users when you only want them to be able to view your remote computer.

This section will go over how you can manage your settings to set your remote computer to only accept "View and show" requests.
